Still to-do:

* Make a "recentlyPlayed.json" list of last three recently-picked maps, don't put those into the next map vote.
* Add hampalyzer stat parsing (and de-duplicate requests on the Hampalyzer side)
* Fix-up picking (it should tell who's turn it is to pick)
* Use a "state" variable instead of a bunch of different ones
